            In the Spring-Summer 2024 collection, Yamamoto maintains an imperfect style, infusing unique aesthetics into the designs. Wide-legged trousers, linen shirts, and jackets are secured by stitches and tape, with unfinished seams and excess fabric edges that ensure Yamamoto's distinctive sophistication on each garment. The balance between original beauty and imperfect harmony, coupled with Yamamoto's avant-garde fashion philosophy, creates an impressive collection.
